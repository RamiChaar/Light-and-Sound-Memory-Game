# Lisht-and-Sound-Memory-Game

In this interactive javascript program the objective of the game is to memorize and repeat the patterns presented by the computer. If you pass 8 rounds you win the game. If you make any mistakes, you lose. You can restart the game at any point by clicking the stop button or refreshing the page.

Using the colors and sounds will generally make 8 rounds pretty easy for most people. If you want to kick it up a notch you can increase maxLevels in the .js file.
